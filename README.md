## 🏛️ Project Abstract

This repository contains the source code for an offline-first desktop application engineered for invoice generation and financial management. By leveraging the **Tauri v2** framework, the system binds a high-performance **Rust** backend with a **React 19** frontend interface. Data persistence is handled internally via an embedded **SQLite** database, guaranteeing data isolation and decoupling from external cloud infrastructure.

---

## ⚙️ Core Technical Features

### 1. Embedded Database Architecture

Implementation of a local-first storage model using SQLite via `sqlx`. All transactional data (clients, invoices, items) is encrypted at rest and resides strictly within the host machine's protected AppData directories.

### 2. High-Performance Systems Interop

The Tauri bridge facilitates near-native execution speeds. Resource-intensive tasks, such as PDF generation and file system I/O operations, are delegated to the multi-threaded Rust backend, preventing blocking on the React DOM rendering thread.

### 3. Memory Safety & Security

Rust's strict ownership model eradicates customary vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and null pointer dereferences. The application requires zero ambient network access, significantly minimizing the attack surface.

## ⚡ Installation & Development

### Prerequisites

- **Rust Toolchain**: Install via `rustup`
- **Node.js**: `v20+`
- **Platform Dependencies**: Xcode CLI (macOS), Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows), or `build-essential` & `libwebkit2gtk` (Linux).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LuisSambrano/invoice-automation-saas.git
   cd invoice-automation-saas
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the local development environment:**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

### Production Build

Create signed binaries according to your host operating system:

```bash
# macOS (Universal binary compiling)
npm run tauri build -- --target universal-apple-darwin

# Windows (MSI / EXE)
npm run tauri build
```

## 🎨 Code Standards

This repository enforces strict engineering standards:

1. `npm run lint` must yield zero frontend errors.
2. `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` must pass securely across the entire Rust backend.
3. No `any` types allowed in TS; use strict typing or `unknown` with Type Guards.
4. Conventional Commits are required for version control.
